### Singly vs. Doubly Linked Lists  
- Singly Linked-List  
  - easier to implement  
  - takes up less memory  
  - faster to add or delete if you are only concerned with the next node   
- Doubly Linked-List  
  - easy access to both ends of the list  
  - can delete previous node without traversing from head node
